# HangMan

    ∙   The program randomlyselects a word.
    ∙   The program displays the word using the underscore character "_".
    ∙   With the word "ELEPHANT" the game would display"_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _".
    ∙   A underscore for each letter separated with a space.
    ∙   The player is prompted to enter a letter as a guess. The program needs to capture their guess.
    ∙   If the letter is in the word the program should recognize this.
    ∙   If the letter is not in the word the player loses a life.
    ∙   The program should store the guesses.
    ∙   After a guess the program should print out the following:
    ∙   The word with blanks / correct guesses re-displayed e.g E _ E _ _ _ _ _
    ∙   The letters guessed so far e.g Letters guessed: E G
    ∙   The amount of lives left e.g Lives: 8
    ∙   The game continues with the player guessing more letters until the player correctly guesses the word or theylose all their lives.
